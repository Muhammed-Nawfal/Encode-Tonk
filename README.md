## 🧠 What Is Lumio?

Welcome to **Lumio**, your new academic BFF.  
It’s like if Google Calendar, Notion, and ChatGPT had a baby… but raised it in a library, fed it Red Bull, and taught it to vibe.

We built **three mini-apps** that are smarter together, like the Powerpuff Girls, but for studying:

| 🧩 Mini-App   | Superpower |
|--------------|------------|
| **NoteBank** | Take notes with tags so organized they make Marie Kondo cry |
| **SemSync**  | Track deadlines, classes, exams, existential dread |
| **CramBot**  | AI that turns your chaos into flashcards & motivational guilt |

All talking through the **Tonk stack**, which is basically a magical, decentralized, private brain for your apps 🧙‍♂️✨

## ⚙️ Tech Stack – aka “Stuff We Glued Together at 3AM”

- 🧠 **Tonk Toolchain** – the secret sauce (shared datastore, decentralized wizardry)
- ⚛️ **React + Vite** – because we like fast builds and snappy UIs
- 🪄 **OpenAI API** – CramBot’s brain (don’t worry, it’s friendly… for now)
- ⏰ **date-fns** – we needed something to understand time because we don’t
- 🍕 **Pizza** – not a tech but extremely important
