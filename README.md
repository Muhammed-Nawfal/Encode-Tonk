# 🌙 Lumio – The Student Life Hack You Didn’t Know You Needed

> Built in 48 hours of sleep-deprived wizardry at Encode Hackathon London 2025

## 🧠 What Is Lumio?

Welcome to *Lumio*, your new academic BFF.  
It’s like if Google Calendar, Notion, and ChatGPT had a baby… but raised it in a library, fed it Red Bull, and taught it to vibe.

We built *three mini-apps* that are smarter together, like the Powerpuff Girls, but for studying:

| 🧩 Mini-App   | Superpower |
|--------------|------------|
| *NoteBank* | Take notes with tags so organized they make Marie Kondo cry |
| *SemSync*  | Track deadlines, classes, exams, existential dread |
| *CramBot*  | AI that turns your chaos into flashcards & motivational guilt |

All talking through the *Tonk stack*, which is basically a magical, decentralized, private brain for your apps 🧙‍♂✨

## ⚙ Tech Stack – aka “Stuff We Glued Together at 3AM”

- 🧠 *Tonk Toolchain* – the secret sauce (shared datastore, decentralized wizardry)
- ⚛ *React + Vite* – because we like fast builds and snappy UIs
- 🪄 *OpenAI API* – CramBot’s brain (don’t worry, it’s friendly… for now)
- ⏰ *date-fns* – we needed something to understand time because we don’t
- 🍕 *Pizza* – not a tech but extremely important

## 🕵‍♀ How the Magic Happens


You → Write notes & deadlines
     ↓
Tonk → Glues it all together
     ↓
CramBot → Summarizes it into flashcards and pings you before your grades drop
