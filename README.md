🌟 Lumio – The Student Life Hack You Didn’t Know You Needed
Built in 48 hours of sleep-deprived wizardry at Encode Hackathon – London 2025

🧠 What Is Lumio?
Meet your new academic BFF.

It’s like if Google Calendar, Notion, and ChatGPT had a baby…
...but raised it in a library, fed it Red Bull, and taught it to vibe.

We built three mini-apps that are smarter together – like the Powerpuff Girls, but for studying:

🧩 Mini-App	💥 Superpower
NoteBank	Take notes with tags so organized they make Marie Kondo cry
SemSync	Track deadlines, classes, exams, and existential dread
CramBot	AI that turns your chaos into flashcards & motivational guilt
All powered by the Tonk stack – a magical, decentralized, private brain for your apps 🧙‍♂✨

⚙ Tech Stack – aka “Stuff We Glued Together at 3AM”
🧠 Tonk Toolchain – The secret sauce (shared datastore, decentralized wizardry)

⚛ React + Vite – Because we like fast builds and snappy UIs

🪄 Ollama – CramBot’s brain (don’t worry, it’s friendly… for now)

⏰ date-fns – We needed something to understand time because we don’t

🍕 Pizza – Not a tech, but deeply essential

🎥 Demo Vibes
Warning: These GIFs may cause inspiration and/or FOMO.

📝 NoteBank
“Wait, I actually remember what I wrote?” – You, next exam season.

📅 SemSync
Keeping track of deadlines like your mom with a clipboard.

🤖 CramBot
"Flashcards generated. Guilt trip initialized."

🕵‍♀ How the Magic Happens
You

Tonk
